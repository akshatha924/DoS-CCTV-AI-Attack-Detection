# DoS-CCTV-AI-Attack-Detection
AI-based DoS Attack Detection and Prevention System for CCTV Surveillance Networks using Machine Learning
# 🚨 AI-Based DoS Attack Detection in CCTV Surveillance Networks

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack detection system for CCTV surveillance networks using Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes network traffic data in real time and classifies it as normal or attack traffic.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze CCTV network traffic patterns
- Detect DoS attacks using machine learning
- Simulate real-time attack detection
- Improve security of surveillance systems

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
